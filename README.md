Driven by curiosity 💡 and fueled by coffee ☕

## Research interests
I am interested in developing machine learning methods capable of understanding and forecasting evolving physical systems such as:
- weather ⛈️ 
- waves 🌊
- fluids 🚰

## Work
I co-author NeuralPDE, a hybrid method for predicting the evolution of PDE-guided systems by combining convolutions with differentiable ODE solvers [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07671) 

I co-author DynaBench, a benchmark and framework for testing ML models for different tasks related to dynamical systems guided by PDEs [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05805) [Repo Link](https://github.com/badulion/dynabench)

I co-author TaylorNet, a model for extracting the dynamics of physical systems from scattered spatiotemporal observation points [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14511)
